## Overview
Our project intends to model off the Bloons Tower Defense series. This means a variety of Bloon types that don’t have a specific HP number but rather layers of Health. For example, a green bloon would take 3 hits to pop. Once a green bloon is popped, it turns into a blue bloon, which then turns into a red bloon. Then after red it pops for good. The “towers” that are defending are monkeys that have different “abilities”. For example a dart monkey throws regular darts at the bloons and a wizard monkey can throw magic at a bloon. As the rounds progress the bloons will get harder to pop. You can get money by popping a bloon or by winning a round. You use money to get monkeys.
## Instructions

The bloons goes from the start of the path to the end and once it reaches the end you lose however much layers the bloon has.
If you reach 0 lives then you lose the game.
