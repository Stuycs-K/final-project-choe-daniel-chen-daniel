## Overview
Our project intends to model off the Bloons Tower Defense series. This means a variety of Bloon types that don’t have a specific HP number but rather layers of Health. For example, a green bloon would take 3 hits to pop. Once a green bloon is popped, it turns into a blue bloon, which then turns into a red bloon. Then after red it pops for good. The “towers” that are defending are monkeys that have different “abilities”. For example a dart monkey throws regular darts at the bloons and a wizard monkey can throw magic at a bloon. As the rounds progress the bloons will get harder to pop. You can get money by popping a bloon or by winning a round. You use money to get monkeys.
## Instructions

The bloons goes from the start of the path to the end and once it reaches the end you lose however much layers the bloon has.
If you reach 0 lives then you lose the game.

Click on a monkey on the side bar and then move your mouse to the map and click again to place.
You cannot place on a monkey or on the road. All tower placements are final

Click on upgrades at the bottom to upgrade your monkeys. Need to have enough cash to do so.
Amount of cash needed is told on the screen

Press stop and go button if you want to stop the game or continue the game.
Press continue once you finished a wave and want to do the next wave.

Bloons:

Purple: immune to supermonkey plasma beams 
Lead: Immune to all regular darts.
Camo: Only monkeys that are able to see camos are able to hit it(ninja)
Regrow: able to layer its health up to its origin layer
Moab: Blimp that has a lot more health than a regular bloon and splits into more bloons
Red Blimp: A bigger and meaner blimp that has more health than a moab and splits into a moab
